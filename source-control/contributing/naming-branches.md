# Naming branches

In the beginning of a new project the team agrees on the project conventions including the branch naming strategy.

Here's an example of a branch naming convention:

```plaintext
feature/<feature name>      New features
bug/<issue description>     Bug fixes
```

The example above is just that - an example. The team can choose to omit or add parts. Choosing a branch convention can depend on the development model (e.g. [trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/)), [versioning](../versioning/readme.md) model, tools used in managing source control, matter of taste etc. Focus on simplicity and reducing ambiguity; a good branch naming strategy allows the team to understand the purpose and ownership of each branch in the repository.
