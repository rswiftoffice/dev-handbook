# Getting started

Welcome to the team, we're super excited to have you! Swift Office is a growing team of developers in the Airforce. Here is an outline of things you need to do/know before you start digging in.

## Accounts creation

These are the services that we use in our daily workflow. Ask [Jonathan](https://github.com/voyager163) or [Kevin](https://github.com/19hours) to add you to them and assign you the relevant permissions.

### Microsoft azure

Members need access to create and manage their own resource groups and applications on the azure portal. You will be assigned your own username (e.g kevin.chu@swiftoffice.org) to login.

### Github

Members need to create their own github accounts before they can be added to the organisation. We use github to host and manage projects. You should have been accepted into our organisation if you're reading this handbook since it's a private repository.

### App and play store

For members involved in mobile application projects, you will be given your application's permissions so you can manage it yourself on the app stores. Please follow the ios and android guides.

## Coding styles

Every project can have its own individual code style but it is recommended to follow the industry's best practices for your language. For example, you should aim to follow PEP 8 for python.

### Styles

| Language      | Style                                                                      | 
| ------------- |----------------------------------------------------------------------------| 
| Python        | [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)                         | 
| Dart          | [Dart Style](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)        |
