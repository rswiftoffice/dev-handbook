# Welcome! #

👍🎉 First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉👍

If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact [Jonathan](https://github.com/voyager163) or [Kevin](https://github.com/19hours).
