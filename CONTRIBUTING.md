# Welcome! #

üëçüéâ First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâüëç

If you're unsure about anything, just ask -- or submit the issue or pull request anyway. The worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something. We love all friendly contributions.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact [Jonathan](https://github.com/voyager163) or [Kevin](https://github.com/19hours).

## How to contribute

When you have an idea for contribution open an *issue*!

## Git guidance

Consistent with the practices suggested in this playbook, please follow the
specifics regarding git as described in this section.

### Branch naming convention

In this repo, we use the following branch naming conventions:

| Branch Type | Pattern | Example |
| - | - | - |
| Feature | feature/\<issue#>-\<short description> | feature/498-reorganize-scm-section |
| Bug Fix | fix/\<bug#>-\<short description> | bug/978-correct-grammar-myfile.md |

> **Note:**
>
> * Please, do not use personal branches. Work should refer back to a
feature/bug fix in the backlog.
> * Mind the capitalization of the branch prefix (feature, fix). Tools that
display branches as a hierarchy are typically case sensitive, and will display
different hierarchies for the same words with different capitalization.

### Linting

If you use VSCode as your preferred editor, please install the [markdownlint
extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)
and ensure that all rules are followed. This will help ensure consistency in the
look and feel of the documentation in this repo.

You can find information about other linters, general writing guidelines and code review check lists for Markdown in the [Markdown code review recipe](code-reviews/recipes/Markdown.md).

### Contributions and Pull requests

When creating pull requests, follow guidance similar to the one suggested in
this repo, as described in the ["Pull Request Template"](./code-reviews/pull-request-template.md)
section, under "Code Reviews". This includes linking to the work item that
prompted the pull request.

### Merging strategy

The preferred merging strategy for this repo is **linear**.
You can familiarize yourself with [merging strategies](./source-control/contributing/merge-strategies.md) described in the Source Control section of this repo.

## Adding a new section

### Structure/Pattern

Each section consist of the following parts

1. Summary
   1. Explain why this will positively impact the project
   2. What are potential consequences of not using this in my project?
   3. Describe how the concept works
2. Detailed Description
   1. Dive into specific areas of what is described in the above summary (i.e
   Refinement > Estimation > establish baseline estimates)
3. Recipes
   1. Tool specific implementations of the concept
   2. Named patterns or games that implement the concept (usually applies to
   agile ceremonies)

### Example Directory Hierarchy

The following illustrates how the directory structure could be organized.

```plaintext
- /continuous-integration
    - README.md (Conceptual)
    - /e2e-testing-in-ci
        - README.md
    - /static-code-analysis
        - README.md
    - /recipes
        - /azure-devops
            - versioning-ci-builds-in-azure-devops.md
            - sonar-qube-integration.md
            - ci-pipeline-for-dotnet-core.md
