# Android

These are the android guidelines for building and uploading an app to the App Store.

## App settings

**Organisation name**: com.swiftoffice.appName

### Keys and app signing

Use app signing by Google play to manage the key for your app. Itâ€™s a secure way to store your app signing key that helps protect you if your key is ever lost or compromised. You need to publish your app in appbundle format to enroll in this.

Each android app should have its own key and keystore.

keystore naming convention: appName-android-keystore.jks

alias: appName-android-key

password: generate a secure password

**You should generate this key yourself. If you are engaging a vendor to develop your application, do not hand over this key. Sign the application yourself and pass the key to [Jonathan](https://github.com/voyager163) afterwards for safekeeping.**
