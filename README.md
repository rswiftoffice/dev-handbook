HELLO

This is a **WORK IN PROGRESS**. Help us make it better by [submitting an issue](https://github.com/rswiftoffice/dev-handbook/issues/new). Contributing guidelines can be found [here]().

# Swift Engineering Playbook

Welcome to the team, we're super excited to have you! Swift Office is a growing team of developers in the Air Force. Here is an outline of things you need to do/know before you start any projects. An engineer working on a software or data engineering project...

* Has responsibilities to their team – mentor, coach, and lead.
* Knows their **playbook**. Follows their playbook. Fixes their playbook if it is broken. If they find a better playbook, they copy it. If somebody could use your playbook, give them yours.
* Leads by example. Models the behaviors we desire both interpersonally and technically.
* Strives to understand how their work fits into a broader context and ensures the outcome.

This is your playbook. All contributions welcome! Please feel free to submit a pull request to get involved.

## Why Have A Playbook

* To increase overall efficiency for team members and the whole team in general.
* Reduce the number of mistakes and avoid common pitfalls.
* Strive to be a better engineer and learn from other people's shared experience.

## "The" Checklist

If you are starting your software engineering project, you can follow the [Software Engineering Fundamentals Checklist](SOFTENG-FUNDAMENTALS-CHECKLIST.md)! It's here to help follow the Software Engineering Fundamentals.

If you are looking to deploy your application, you can follow the [Deployment Checklist]().

## Structure of a Sprint

If you plan to start your first Agile project or if you wish to understand more on the structure of a Agile sprint, you can take a look at the documentation on [Understanding RSAF Sprint Structure](SPRINT-STRUCTURE.md).

## General Guidance

* Keep the code quality bar high.
* Value quality and precision over ‘getting things done’.
* Work diligently on the one important thing.
* As a distributed team take time to share context via wiki, teams and backlog items.
* Make the simple thing work now. Build fewer features today, but ensure they work amazingly. Then add more features tomorrow.
* Avoid adding scope to a backlog item, instead add a new backlog item.
* Our goal is to ship incremental value to our product owner.
* Keep product backlog item details up to date to communicate the state of things with the rest of your team.
* Report product issues found and provide clear and repeatable engineering feedback!
* We all own our code and each one of us has an obligation to make all parts of the solution great.
